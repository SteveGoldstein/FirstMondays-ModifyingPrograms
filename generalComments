You can start from knowing nothing about the language, but I'll assume
a tiny bit of familiarity with bash scripting.

Ask yourself:  what does this program or section or line or command do?
and make a guess at the answer.   Then either confirm your guess or
move on (but remember that you guessed).

Organize files, directories, code, etc from the beginning. Here's a start:   
	 Put code in a separate directory.
	 Put data in a separate directory.
	 Create a testing data set.

There's always a tradeoff between how much time to spend on learning
new features of the language and just figuring out enough to get the
job done.
