Modifying a bash script to split multi-sequence FastA files into separate files, one for each sequence.

You need to accomplish what ought to be a common computational task so you do the obvious. Google to find a program to fit the bill.  But, alas, of the many potential choices, none can do exactly what you need.  What do you do?   Well, if you're an R (or python or shell or perl ...) expert and you find a pretty-good program is written in R (or python or shell or perl ..) --- no problem.  You modify the code.

But how can you proceed if your language skills are limited?   In this month's session, we will walk through a concrete example, devising strategies for modifying a pretty-good bash script so that it does exactly what's needed, assuming limited knowledge of bash shell scripting.
